# Cryptohome

Cryptohome is a web application made with react, where I consume two APIs [Coinranking](https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/) and [Bing News Serch](https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-news-search1/). The purpouse of this application is to show cryptocurrency data, like news, value, exhange, graphs, or markets.

## Tools & technologies used

- [Coinranking](https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/): API for Crypto Prices - Exchange & Market data
- [Bing News Serch](https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-news-search1/):AI service from Microsoft Azure that turns any app into a news search resource.
